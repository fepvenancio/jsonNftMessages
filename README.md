# jsonNftMessages

This Repo is a Demo of a sample JSON file been created, minted, associated and transfered as an NFT and beeing accessed.

To run this code:

I used 3 hedera wallets (you can change a bit of the code and use 2 or 1 if you dont transfer), the sender(owner) and the receiver.
https://myhbarwallet.com/

I stored the file at web3.storage - need a token API
https://web3.storage/

To use the fetch (import at web3NFTStorage.js file) I installed in my WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04:
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libjpeg-dev libgif-dev librsvg2-d

npm install node-fetch --save

npm i web3.storage

npm i @hashgraph/sdk@^2

npm install dotenv

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code and always remember this was built just as a test demo to see the possibilities of playing with JSON files and NFTs.
